                    <p>Before joining Tesco in September 2014 I moved to Saint-Germain-en-Laye near Paris for 6 months to live the French dream with my Polish half, Roksana. Then we moved back to the UK in Hertford. Now I am currently living in Bengaluru, India on a 3 month placement for Tesco.</p>

                <h2>What I like</h2>
                <p>I enjoy being outside in the mountains, hiking and biking in the summer and snowboarding in the winter. When indoors, I will play video games, watch TV and occasionally read a good book. Skyrim, Game of Thrones, Jurassic Park and the Eragon trilogy are probably my favourites. I also like to experiment with different foods and if I am not eating alone I enjoy cooking for a group. Homemade pizza, mint pesto with hazelnuts and honey glazed ribs are some of my most recent experiments.</p>

            <h2>Team 27</h2>
            <article class="intro">
                <p>I am part of the Technology Graduate Scheme working in 'Property, Plan Product and Commercial Workbench'.</p>
                <p>We are a Product and Service team, supporting the Assortment Planning tools and the Product Location Service, while beginning development of the Range Service.</p>
                <p>
In essence, the team looks after a large part of the end to end product life cycle in Tesco. Starting at the product induction, through the buying process and ranging events all the down to the allocation of products from depots to stores three weeks before launch.</p>
                <p>Since joining I have completed a Run Audit for my team, then I was a Technology Manager on the Telecoms MI project and after I took up the role of Product Owner for the SRD Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CICD) implementation.</p>

                    <h3>Run Audit</h3>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>I joined the team soon after a large restructure and the team was new to managing both run and development simultaneously. 
                            <br>I catalogued the current state of all applications the team looked after. Then I worked with the team to improve the run processes to ensure all applications had a basic level run support in place. Such as: implementing weekly calls for the whole run team to review the service, and standardising the service helpdesk handover to provide smoother service for customers.
                            <br>Finally, later in the year I worked on standardising and automating a Run Summary Report so the team could quickly and reliably get their run information.</p>

                    <h3>Telecoms MI, Technology Manager</h3>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Around January two team members left and I got the opportunity to step in and cover for one of them on the Telecoms Reporting Project.</p>
                        <p>The Telecoms business team asked us to build a live detailed sales report for the Phoneshop store managers and the area managers. The project was already near completion when I joined but there were many issues that needed to be ironed out before it could be placed in production.</p>
                        <p>During this project I worked with the team in Bengaluru and the stakeholders in the commercial team to make sure that all the issues they raised didnâ€™t have any new requirements and that they were fixed to proper standard.</p>

                    <h3>SRD CICD, product Owner</h3>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>The Space Range and Display suite of application is live in all twelve countries that Tesco operated in. There are three different major versions throughout the countries and additionally each country has individual customisations. This makes maintaining and upgrading very difficult and time consuming for the team, as well as frustrating for the customer who use outdated software.</p>
                        <p>The focus of this project is to improve the engineering platform for SRD to a single code base across all countries and the ability to automatically deploy new code everywhere reliably.</p>
                        <p>As a Product Owner I worked closely with the Solution Architect and the Tech Expert to refine what was needed to achieve this goal and the reasons why it is important to do it in such a way. Then I broke down the larger tasks into manageable user stories to add to the backlog so that the development team could quickly progress from one story to the other.</p>
